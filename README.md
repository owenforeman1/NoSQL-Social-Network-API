# NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Description

I wanted to create the backend for a social network app. This was created with Mongodb and stores users, thoughts and reactions. I learned a lot about mongo and backend for apps. I struggled with contollers but this app helped me a lot and I understand them much more now.
